# ml5jsTest
A simple test of ml5.js with p5.js, for future use in SVL


I'm working mainly from the example [here](https://github.com/CodingTrain/website/tree/master/Courses/beginner_ml5/06_feature_extractor_load_save).

Also see info [here](https://github.com/ml5js/ml5-library), and examples [here](https://github.com/ml5js/ml5-examples).

Some other notes below (will clean up later)...


trying this example:
https://github.com/ml5js/ml5-examples/tree/master/p5js/ImageClassification/ImageClassification_Video

but some of the code is outdated, see here : https://ml5js.org/docs/video-classification-example

to train, see here: https://ml5js.org/docs/training-introduction

and here: https://ml5js.org/docs/FeatureExtractor

and here: https://github.com/ml5js/ml5-examples/blob/master/p5js/FeatureExtractor/FeatureExtractor_Image_Classification/sketch.js

This looks cool too: https://github.com/gitalm/EarlyFlowers/tree/master

see this: coding train : https://github.com/CodingTrain/website/tree/master/Courses/beginner_ml5

maybe this: https://github.com/CodingTrain/website/blob/master/Courses/beginner_ml5/07_knn_classifier/sketch.js
